Fast tomography control on FEI electron microscopy with GUI  
1. Requirements: temscript, opencv-python, matplitlib, numpy, mss  
2. The first button enables the microscopy control. Then you must successfully connect to a microscopy to use the controlling functions. Without microscopy control enabled you may freely explore the functions, which will not actually interact with anything.
3. Set the camera to continuous recording mode and let the app look at the display port. This is how this app works and it is faster than calling the camera API.
